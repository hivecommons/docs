# Dibs — a marketplace of ideas

> **Your idea, your credit, their code.**
>
> The missing contributor layer for the AI-agent era.

Dibs is a two-sided marketplace that connects **ideators** — people who call
dibs on ideas: great insight, but no time, tooling, or inclination to write
code — with **hive-managed repositories** whose AI agent swarms are hungry
for well-formed work.

1. **Ideators post ideas** — public or private — in plain language / markdown.
2. **Repos opt in** to receive ideas, declaring topics and appetite.
3. **An LLM matches** ideas to repos that want them; both sides must say yes.
4. On **mutual acceptance**, Dibs hands the ideator a **prefilled GitHub
   issue** — they file it themselves, under their own GitHub account, so the
   issue is natively attributed to them (label `ideated`). The hive's AI
   agents implement it. Dibs is just the matchmaker: it never files the
   issue for you.

## Ideators are first-class contributors

Open source has always had a quiet contributor class with no outlet:
researchers, operators, designers, power users — people who know exactly what
a project needs but will never open a pull request. Open source has also
always known ideas are contributions — the all-contributors spec has a 💡
"ideas" emoji, and the academic CRediT taxonomy credits "Conceptualization"
as a first-class role. Dibs makes that credit real, machine-readable, and
public.

**Creators get credit. Agents do the work. Projects take the bow.**

Every implemented idea traces back to its ideator: the GitHub issue credits
the idea's author, the resulting work carries that provenance, and the public
**credit wall** (`/api/credits`, "Credit wall" in the UI) lists every ideator
whose idea shipped. An idea is a contribution.

## Architecture

Single Go binary (`cmd/dibs`) serving both the JSON API and an embedded
static UI, deployed at its own subdomain: **dibs.hivecommons.dev**. The base
path is configurable (`DIBS_BASE_PATH`), so path-prefixed reverse-proxy
deployments also work.

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pkg/server` | HTTP server, base-path routing, embedded UI |
| `pkg/auth` | Auth bridge — validates the hive hub session cookie against the hub |
| `pkg/store` | Idea model + JSON file store (atomic writes, no external DB), offer/settlement state machine |
| `pkg/api` | Idea CRUD + matching/offer/feed/decide/notification API (author-scoped, private ideas never leak) |
| `pkg/registry` | Hive-managed repo profiles + "accepting ideas" opt-in |
| `pkg/match` | LLM idea↔repo scoring via litellm gateway, cached TLDRs, "✨ Embellish" draft refinement, deterministic keyword fallback |
| `pkg/settle` | Settlement — prefilled GitHub new-issue URL the ideator files themselves (`ideated` label, 🐝 Dibs footer, URL-length budget) + issue-URL confirmation; legacy token mode. Ideas can target ANY GitHub repo: non-hive targets skip acceptance and their issues carry a "request a hive" growth CTA |
| `pkg/notify` | In-app notification feed (bell): matches, offers, decisions, issues |

### Configuration

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DIBS_BASE_PATH` | `/` | Base path every route/asset is served under (set e.g. `/ideas` for path-prefixed proxying) |
| `DIBS_ADDR` | `:8080` | Listen address |
| `HUB_URL` | `https://hive.hivecommons.dev` | Hive hub for session validation & repo sync |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` | JSON store directory |
| `REPOS_SEED_FILE` | (unset) | Static JSON seed of repo profiles for dev/demo |
| `DIBS_LLM_BASE_URL` | (unset) | OpenAI-compatible gateway (hive litellm), e.g. `http://litellm:4000/v1`. Unset → deterministic keyword matcher |
| `DIBS_LLM_API_KEY` | (unset) | Bearer token for the LLM gateway |
| `DIBS_LLM_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` | Model name routed by the gateway |
| `DIBS_GITHUB_TOKEN` | (unset) | **Legacy mode only.** When set, Dibs opens the credited issue server-side on accept. Unset (default), the ideator files a prefilled GitHub issue themselves — native attribution |

Legacy `IDEATE_*` names (the pre-rename prefix) are still honored as
fallbacks for every `DIBS_*` variable.

### Roadmap

- **Wave 1 (done):** scaffold, hub auth bridge, idea CRUD, repo registry.
- **Wave 2 (done):** LLM matching + TLDRs, swipe UX ("offer" / "pass"), issue settlement (credited GitHub issues), notifications.
- **Wave 3 (done):** deployment (GHCR image + [`deploy/` manifests](https://github.com/hivecommons/dibs/blob/main/deploy/README.md) for dibs.hivecommons.dev), public landing page, public credit wall, ideator profile stats.
- **Wave 4 (done):** matchmaker settlement — the ideator files a prefilled GitHub issue themselves (native attribution, `ideated` label) and confirms the issue URL; LLM-assisted idea refinement on posting and repo-tailored expansion on submission; token-based settlement demoted to legacy.
- **Later:** cookie-domain/hub-OAuth session sharing, non-hive receptor repos, idea economics.

## Deployment

Every push to `main` publishes `ghcr.io/hivecommons/dibs` (`latest` +
commit sha) via `.github/workflows/docker.yml`; the image is distroless and
runs as non-root. Plain Kubernetes manifests for **dibs.hivecommons.dev**
(Deployment, Service, cert-manager TLS Ingress, PVC, ConfigMap/Secret) live
in [`deploy/`](https://github.com/hivecommons/dibs/blob/main/deploy/README.md), including the required DNS record and
hub-cookie prerequisites.

## Public surface (no sign-in required)

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | Landing page (pitch + sign-in) — signed-in users get the full app |
| `GET /api/credits` | Credit wall data: settled ideas only (handle, title, TLDR, repo, issue URL) |
| `GET /healthz` | Health + embedded git version |

Everything else requires a hive hub session; signed-in ideators additionally
get `GET /api/me/stats` (ideas posted / offered / accepted / settled).

## Submit ideas from your agent

Dibs exposes a stateless Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint at
`https://dibs.hivecommons.dev/mcp`, so Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Cursor, and
other MCP clients can submit ideas without leaving the agent.

Available tools:

| Tool | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `submit_idea(title, description, tags?)` | Required | Creates a private draft idea owned by you and returns its id and API URL |
| `list_my_ideas()` | Required | Lists your ideas with lifecycle phase/status |
| `get_idea(id)` | Optional for public ideas; required for your private ideas | Shows detail, matches, offers, and settlement state |
| `list_repos()` | Not required | Lists registered repo venues |

### Token

Use `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Dibs first asks the Hive Hub
`/api/saas/whoami` endpoint to verify the bearer token server-to-server; the
hub already accepts GitHub bearer tokens for registered hub users. If that is
not practical, copy the raw `hive_hub_user` cookie value from your browser
after signing in at `https://hive.hivecommons.dev`; Dibs falls back to verifying
that value through the same hub `whoami` cookie flow used by the web UI.

In Chrome/Edge: open DevTools → Application → Cookies →
`https://hive.hivecommons.dev` (or `https://dibs.hivecommons.dev`) → copy the
`hive_hub_user` value.

### Claude Code

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http dibs https://dibs.hivecommons.dev/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <your-token-or-hive_hub_user-cookie-value>"
```

### Claude Desktop and ChatGPT connectors

Both accept a remote MCP server over Streamable HTTP, so the same endpoint
works without a local process.

Claude Desktop: Settings -> Connectors -> Add custom connector, with the URL
`https://dibs.hivecommons.dev/mcp`. Where the connector UI allows a custom
header, set `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the read-only tools work without
one, and `submit_idea` needs it.

ChatGPT: Settings -> Connectors -> Add custom connector (available on plans
where custom MCP connectors are enabled), using the same URL and header.

## Recall ideas you never acted on

Dibs ships an MCP prompt, `recall_ideas`, for the ideas that never made it to
a form: the ones mentioned in passing and forgotten. Dibs cannot find those
itself - only the assistant holding your history can - so the prompt asks it
to.

It instructs the assistant to search its memory and your past conversations
for product ideas, feature wishes, requirements and specs you described but
never acted on, report each with enough context to act on, and then ask which
ones to list. It submits only what you pick.

| Argument | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scope` | Optional focus - a project, a repo, a period like "the last year". Omit to search everything available. |
| `limit` | Maximum candidates to report. Defaults to 10, capped at 50. |

In Claude Code and Claude Desktop the prompt appears as a slash command once
the connector is added. Clients that do not surface prompts in their UI can
still call `prompts/get` directly.

### Generic MCP JSON
